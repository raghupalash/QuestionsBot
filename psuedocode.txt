During a schedule, user presses reply button on an "included" question to answer it.

When bot recieves the response, it will do the following - 
- Check if it's during a schedule, if yes, then which schedule?
    - If no schedule returned, then don't go further.
- First get the question sheet from the schedule then return the question number of the answered question.
- In the attendance sheet, goes ahead and puts the questions in front of username.

If unexpectedly closed, and garbage not collected, then our run_time logic can suffer.

- handle_responses function is collecting the responses and adding them to the attendance sheet while the test is 
running.
    - Check the current group of response.
    - Find the attendance sheet => group the test has been going on.
    - we have to fill entries => answered(list of answers) and QA(count)
    - Find which question has been answered.
    - Find the columns to be filled => group[1].
