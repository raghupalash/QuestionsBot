During a schedule, user presses reply button on an "included" question to answer it.

When bot revieves the response, it will do the following - 
- Check if it's during a schedule, if yes, then which schedule?
    - If no schedule returned, then don't go further.
- First get the question sheet from the schedule then return the question number of the answered question.
- In the attendance sheet, goes ahead and puts the questions in front of username.

If unexpectedly closed, and garbage not collected, then our run_time logic can suffer.
